## Task 9: Analyze Your Image with Docker Scout
# 🛡️ Docker Scout: Security Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
**Docker Scout** helps analyze container images for security vulnerabilities, best practices, and dependency risks. This document details the commands executed, the findings, and improvements made to secure Docker images.  

---

## 🔍 **1. Running Docker Scout Quickview**  
The **quickview** command provides a high-level security summary of the image.  


1) Install docker scout as a plugin Linux:

    ```bash
    ubuntu@MYLINUXEC2:/opt/docker/weather-app$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh -o install-scout.sh
    ubuntu@MYLINUXEC2:/opt/docker/weather-app$  sh install-scout.sh
    [info] fetching release script for tag='v1.16.1'
    ubuntu@MYLINUXEC2:/opt/docker/weather-app$  docker scout version
    version: v1.16.1 (go1.23.4 - linux/amd64)
    ```

### 🔬 2. Scanning for Vulnerabilities (CVE Analysis)

To detect known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in an image:

```bash
docker scout cves <image-name> > docker-scout-cves.txt
```
```bash
docker scout cves my-secure-app:latest > docker-scout-cves.txt
```

✔ Lists all security vulnerabilities in the image.

✔ Provides CVE details and severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).


## 📊 Comparing Image Security Over Time
- To compare two versions of an image and track security improvements:
```bash
docker scout compare <old-image> <new-image>
docker scout compare my-secure-app:v1 my-secure-app:v2

```


## 🔧  Implementing Fixes Based on Scout Reports

- Use a more secure base image:
    ```bash
        FROM python:3.9-slim  # Instead of python:3.9
    ```
- Minimize unnecessary dependencies in requirements.txt
- Regularly update images to get security patches
-  Re-run Docker Scout after fixes to validate improvements.


###🚀 Final Thoughts on Docker Security
- Docker Scout helps in identifying and mitigating security risks efficiently. Regularly scanning images ensures:
✅ Better security compliance
✅ Reduced attack surface
✅ Optimized & lightweight container images

**🔹 Next Steps: Integrate Docker Scout into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security monitoring! 🔒**
