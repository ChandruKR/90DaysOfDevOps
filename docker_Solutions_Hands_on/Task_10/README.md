# 🐳 Docker Project: Documentation & Critical Reflection  

This document provides a step-by-step guide to the commands executed, explanations of improvements made, and a reflection on Docker’s impact on modern software development.  

---

## 📌 Task Breakdown & Commands  

### **1️⃣ Multi-Stage Builds for Image Optimization**  
To reduce image size and improve security, I implemented **multi-stage builds** in the `Dockerfile`.  

#### **Updated Dockerfile**  
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM python:3.9 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Final Image
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
✔ Reduced Image Size – Only essential files are in the final image.
✔ Improved Security – Removed unnecessary build tools from the final image.

Command to Build and Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker build -t optimized-flask-app .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 optimized-flask-app
2️⃣ Docker Scout for Security Analysis
Used Docker Scout to scan for vulnerabilities and generate reports.

Commands Executed:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker scout quickview optimized-flask-app > docker-scout-quickview.txt
docker scout cves optimized-flask-app > docker-scout-cves.txt
docker scout recommendations optimized-flask-app > docker-scout-report.txt
✔ Identified CVEs and recommended base image updates.
✔ Improved Security Posture by addressing vulnerabilities.

3️⃣ Running Multi-Container Application with Docker Compose
Created a two-tier application with Flask and MySQL.

Docker Compose File (docker-compose.yml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3.8"

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: mysql1
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: admin
      MYSQL_DATABASE: chandrudb
      MYSQL_USER: admin
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: admin
    volumes:
      - ./mysql_new_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - twotier
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "127.0.0.1", "-uroot", "-padmin"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s

  flask-app:
    build:
      context: .
    container_name: flask-app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql1
      MYSQL_USER: admin
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: admin
      MYSQL_DB: chandrudb
    networks:
      - twotier
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy

networks:
  twotier:

volumes:
  mysql_new_data:
✔ Ensured Data Persistence – Used volumes for MySQL.
✔ Secure Communication – Used a custom network (twotier).
✔ Service Health Check – Ensured MySQL was ready before starting Flask.

Command to Deploy Containers:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up -d --build
4️⃣ Checking Running Containers & Logs
sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps
docker-compose logs -f
✔ Verified all services were running correctly.

Stopping and Removing Containers:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose down -v
🏗️ Critical Reflection: Docker's Impact on Modern Software Development
Docker has transformed modern software development by providing:

✅ Portability: Applications run the same way across different environments.
✅ Scalability: Containers can be easily scaled up/down in cloud environments.
✅ Security & Isolation: Containers provide sandboxed environments.
✅ Efficiency: Lightweight images reduce resource consumption compared to full VMs.
✅ Faster Deployments: CI/CD pipelines leverage Docker for automated builds and deployments.

However, Docker also presents challenges:

⚠ Security Risks – Vulnerable images may lead to security breaches.
⚠ Storage Overhead – Large images consume excessive disk space.
⚠ Networking Complexity – Multi-container setups require careful network management.

Despite these challenges, Docker remains an essential tool for DevOps, microservices, and cloud-native applications. 🚀
